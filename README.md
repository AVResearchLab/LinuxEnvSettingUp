# Linux Environment Setting Up

Every time I face some problems on my virtual machine crashing I have to redo lots of work to prepare my Linux environment on newly installed system, which could actually be done by a machine. I wrote down these pipelined steps so as to accelerate my work while preparing my LInux environment.
  
This is the repository that speeds my initialization and installation process of a new Linux environment.




# Prepared Environmt

This repo has been successfully tested based on Ubuntu 20.04 Focal installed on VMWare Work Station 16 Pro.
Here are some background environments:
1. VM Ware Work Station 16 Pro
2. Ubuntu 20.04 Focal from official website
3. With enough space for Ubuntu virtual machine (or a real one if you don't want to install VM)
